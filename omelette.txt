1) Preheat some oil (preferably extra virgin olive oil) in a pan. 
2) Grab an egg, break it and put both the yolk and the white in a bowl.
3) Whisk everything with a bit of salt and once the mixture is a liquid
without too much viscosity, pour it on the pan. It will spread to occupy
the full pan, leave it like that for around 5-10", then roll it on itself.
4) Turn it a couple of times to cook it well, and once it's done, pick it
and place it on a plate.
